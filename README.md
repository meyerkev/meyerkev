- 👋 Hi, I’m @meyerkev
- 👀 I’m interested in ops, devops, SRE, doing the work to be incredibly lazy
- 🌱 I’m currently learning by setting up a homelab buildout for Kubernetes and self-hosted Docker registries
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that my employer will legally let me do and that's willing to put up with oncall schedules.  
- 📫 How to reach me: meyerkev248@gmail.com
